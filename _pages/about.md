I'm Nicolas, a postdoctoral researcher at KU Leuven working on magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), a domain of plasma physics. My PhD thesis focuses on instabilities in black hole accretion disks and on solar prominence formation and can be found [here](https://perswww.kuleuven.be/~u0016541//MHD_sheets_pdf/thesisNicolas.pdf).

* Solar physics: prominences, waves in the solar corona
* Astrophysics: black hole accretion disks

As a Master student, I studied thermal instability and its role in prominence formation in the solar atmosphere. In particular, I looked at the effect of various models for the corona by performing 2.5D MHD simulations using [MPI-AMRVAC](https://amrvac.org). In my first PhD year, I continued on this work and developed a method to incorporate the 3D effects of thermal conduction and heat loss along a flux rope in 2D, which involved tracking a flux rope during runtime based on the magnetic field curvature. This combined work resulted in a first publication. 

The main topic of my PhD is MHD spectroscopy for accretion disks, where we map the complete spectrum of Fourier modes at all possible wavelengths for cylindrical disk models. In addition to the well-known axisymmetric, weak field Magneto-rotational Instability [(MRI)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1991ApJ...376..214B/abstract), a careful analysis has revealed the completely new non-axisymmetric [Super-Alfv√©nic Rotational Instability](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4365/ac573c/meta) (SARI) in such disks, with important implications for stability and turbulence. I studied the consequences of such modes in my second paper and an upcoming third paper. I'm also interested in exploring the connection between SARIs and pseudomodes, and making the connection to laboratory experiments with rotating cylinders. For looking at these linear instabilities, I use the [Legolas](https://legolas.science) code developed at KU Leuven.

I've been musically active since a long time, first at the piano and since my University years in the Leuven University Choir. I'm passionate about many genres of music, but in particular Dmitri Shostakovich. -->
